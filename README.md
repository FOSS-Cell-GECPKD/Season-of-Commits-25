## Introduction

This proposal outlines the plan for hosting Season Of Commits Fest 2025.Season Of Commits Fest is inspired by the global Hacktoberfest initiative, aimed at encouraging open-source contributions through collaboration, learning, and hands-on project development. By organizing this event at our college, we aim to foster an open-source culture, provide students with practical experience, and enable them to contribute to real-world projects while enhancing their technical skills.

## Timeline

The plan is to conduct a season of commits during the month of January 3-4 weeks full of contributions, short and interesting sessions on topics like self hosting, project setups. Ideally have a workshop/tutorial on very useful software solutions, or frameworks ideally one session per week.Â 

## Objective

The primary objective of Season Of Commits Fest 2025 is to engage students in contributing to open-source repositories managed by various teams within our college. The event seeks to empower students to make meaningful contributions to software projects, ranging from bug fixes to feature development, while helping them understand the dynamics of collaboration in the open-source community.

## Resources Required

- Access to open-source repositories on GitHub.

- A system for tracking contributions and maintaining the leaderboard.

- Prizes and awards for contributors.

- A team of mentors and maintainers to guide and review contributions.

## Event Scope

Season Of Commits Fest 2025 will be a month-long event where students across different departments can participate. They will contribute to projects spanning areas such as web development, mobile apps, data science, and more. Mentors will be available throughout the event to guide participants in making impactful contributions.

## Key Areas of Contribution

- Code enhancements and new feature implementation

- Bug fixing and resolution

- Improvements in project documentation

- User experience and design updates

## 1. Open Repositories

Participants will have access to a variety of open-source repositories. Each repository will come with detailed contribution guidelines, making it easier for participants to understand how and where they can contribute. As the maintainers of these repositories are final year students in the college, it will also be easier for students to contact and have insightful discussions with them.

## 2. Contribution Process

Fork and Pull Requests (PRs): Participants will fork the repositories, make their contributions, and submit pull requests.

Types of Contributions: Contributions can range from code development and bug fixes to documentation enhancements and testing.

Review by Maintainers: Each repository will have maintainers responsible for reviewing pull requests, ensuring their quality and relevance, and providing feedback. For a pull request to get approved the PR's should be assigned as review to any two maintainers and only after their approval will the PR get merged into the main repository.

## 3. Evaluation and Point System

Contributions will be evaluated based on:

Code Quality: Well-structured, maintainable, and optimized code will be rewarded with higher points.

Impact: Submissions that address key issues or bring substantial improvements will be recognized with additional points.

Documentation: Enhancing the clarity, structure, and accessibility of documentation will be acknowledged.

## 4. Leaderboard and Recognition

A leaderboard will track the progress of participants, ranking them based on the points they earn for their contributions. This system will encourage healthy competition while rewarding those who make significant, high-quality contributions. The leaderboard will be updated regularly to keep participants motivated.

## 5. Mentorship and Support

Mentors and repository maintainers will provide ongoing support to participants. They will offer guidance on technical challenges, review contributions, and ensure participants have a positive learning experience throughout the event.

## Incentives and Rewards

Participants will be eligible for the following incentives:

Special Prizes: Top contributors will be recognized with awards and prizes.

Recognition within college: The highest-ranked participants will receive public recognition within the college, celebrating their contributions to open-source projects, and get the opportunity to work on official projects for the college.

## Conclusion

Season Of Commits Fest 2025 will provide students at our college with a unique opportunity to engage in open-source software development, enhancing their skills while making meaningful contributions to real-world projects. This event will not only foster collaboration but also help participants build a strong foundation in open-source technologies, preparing them for future careers in tech.

We are excited about the potential of Season Of Commits Fest 2025 to positively impact the student community and encourage long-term participation in open-source development. We look forward to working together to ensure the event's success.
